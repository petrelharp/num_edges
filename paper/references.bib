  abstract = {A metric on general phylogenetic trees is presented. This extends the work of most previous authors, who constructed metrics for binary trees. The metric presented in this paper makes possible the comparison of the many nonbinary phylogenetic trees appearing in the literature. This provides an objective procedure for comparing the different methods for constructing phylogenetic trees. The metric is based on elementary operations which transform one tree into another. Various results obtained in applying these operations are given. They enable the distance between any pair of trees to be calculated efficiently. This generalizes previous work by Bourque to the case where interior vertices can be labeled, and labels may contain more than one element or may be empty.}

  abstract = {As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates “sample weights” within each marginal tree, which are then combined using a “summary function”; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in two dual ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated from genome sequence; and by branch, which gives the expected value of the site statistic under the infinite-sites model of mutation. We use the framework to implement many currently-defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics’ relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit) and suggest several new statistics. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

this length may be expected to vary from case to case. This will
depend greatly on the number of heterogenic tracts in which the

of junctions to supply means of calculating the expected number of
such tracts. Indeed, the asymptotic theory may be completed on
this basis, since in the limit both the number of-tracts and their average

To begin to understand the effects of population history on the extent of LD, we model the length of a tract of identity-by-descent (IBD) between two chromosomes in a finite, random mating population. The variance of an IBD tract is large: a model described by (Genet. Res. Cambridge 35 (1980) 131) underestimates this variance. Using Fisher's concept of junctions, we predict the mean length of an IBD tract, given the age of the population and the population sizes over time. We derive results also for subdivided populations, given times of subdivision events and sizes of the resulting subpopulations. The model demonstrates that population growth and subdivision strongly affect the expected length of an IBD tract in small populations. These effects are less dramatic in large populations.},

Application to 1,000 Genomes Project haplotypes produces joint genealogical histories for 26 human populations. Highly diverged lineages are present in all groups, but most frequent in Africa. Outside Africa, these mainly reflect ancient introgression from groups related to Neanderthals and Denisovans, while African signals instead reflect unknown events unique to that continent.

  abstract = {The Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG), which describes the full genealogical history of a sample of genomes, is a vital tool in population genomics and biomedical research. Recent advancements have increased ARG reconstruction scalability to tens or hundreds of thousands of genomes, but these methods rely on heuristics, which can reduce accuracy, particularly in the presence of model misspecification. Moreover, they reconstruct only a single ARG topology and cannot quantify the considerable uncertainty associated with ARG inferences. To address these challenges, we here introduce SINGER, a novel method that accelerates ARG sampling from the posterior distribution by two orders of magnitude, enabling accurate inference and uncertainty quantification for large samples. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate SINGER{\textquoteright}s enhanced accuracy and robustness to model misspecification compared to existing methods. We illustrate the utility of SINGER by applying it to African populations within the 1000 Genomes Project, identifying signals of local adaptation and archaic introgression, as well as strong support of trans-species polymorphism and balancing selection in HLA regions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In this paper, we describe a way to record all of these relationships, as well as how genetic material is passed down through the pedigree, during a forwards-time population genetic simulation. To make effective use of this information, we describe both efficient storage methods for this embellished pedigree as well as a way to remove all information that is irrelevant to the genetic history of a given set of individuals, which dramatically reduces the required amount of storage space. Storing this information allows us to produce whole-genome sequence from simulations of large populations in which we have not explicitly recorded new genomic mutations; we find that this results in computational run times of up to 50 times faster than simulations forced to explicitly carry along that information.},

Instead, the genomes are related by a complex, interwoven collection of genealogies formalized in a structure called an ancestral recombination graph (ARG). An ARG extensively encodes the ancestry of the genome(s) and thus is replete with valuable information for addressing diverse questions in evolutionary biology. Despite its potential utility, technological and methodological limitations, along with a lack of approachable literature, have severely restricted awareness and application of ARGs in evolution research. Excitingly, recent progress in ARG reconstruction and simulation have made ARG-based approaches feasible for many questions and systems. In this review, we provide an accessible introduction and exploration of ARGs, survey recent methodological breakthroughs, and describe the potential for ARGs to further existing goals and open avenues of inquiry that were previously inaccessible in evolutionary genomics. Through this discussion, we aim to more widely disseminate the promise of ARGs in evolutionary genomics and encourage the broader development and adoption of ARG-based inference.},

In particular, the waiting distance between tree changes along the genome can be used to make inference about the distribution and evolution of recombination rates. To this end, we here derive an analytic expression for the distribution of waiting distances between tree changes under the sequentially Markovian coalescent model and obtain an accurate approximation to the distribution of waiting distances for topology changes. We use these results to show that some of the recently proposed methods for inferring sequences of trees along the genome provide strongly biased distributions of waiting distances.

  abstract = {Genome-wide genealogies compactly represent the evolutionary history of a set of genomes and inferring them from genetic data has the potential to facilitate a wide range of analyses. We introduce a method, ARG-Needle, for accurately inferring biobank-scale genealogies from sequencing or genotyping array data, as well as strategies to utilize genealogies to perform association and other complex trait analyses. We use these methods to build genome-wide genealogies using genotyping data for 337,464 UK Biobank individuals and test for association across seven complex traits. Genealogy-based association detects more rare and ultra-rare signals (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}134, frequency range 0.0007−0.1{\%}) than genotype imputation using {\textasciitilde}65,000 sequenced haplotypes (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}64). In a subset of 138,039 exome sequencing samples, these associations strongly tag (average r{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.72) underlying sequencing variants enriched (4.8{\texttimes}) for loss-of-function variation. These results demonstrate that inferred genome-wide genealogies may be leveraged in the analysis of complex traits, complementing approaches that require the availability of large, population-specific sequencing panels.},

  abstract = {Using simulated data, we compared five methods of phylogenetic tree estimation: parsimony, compatibility, maximum likelihood, Fitch-Margoliash, and neighbor joining. For each combination of substitution rates and sequence length, 100 data sets were generated for each of 50 trees, for a total of 5,000 replications per condition. Accuracy was measured by two measures of the distance between the true tree and the estimate of the tree, one measure sensitive to accuracy of branch lengths and the other not. The distance-matrix methods (Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining) performed best when they were constrained from estimating negative branch lengths; all comparisons with other methods used this constraint. Parsimony and compatibility had similar results, with compatibility generally inferior; Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining had similar results, with neighbor joining generally slightly inferior. Maximum likelihood was the most successful method overall, although for short sequences Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining were sometimes better. Bias of the estimates was inferred by measuring whether the independent estimates of a tree for different data sets were closer to the true tree than to each other. Parsimony and compatibility had particular difficulty with inaccuracy and bias when substitution rates varied among different branches. When rates of evolution varied among different sites, all methods showed signs of inaccuracy and bias.},

abstract = { The Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance, one of the most widely used metrics for comparing phylogenetic trees, has the advantage of being intuitive, with a natural interpretation in terms of common splits, and it can be computed in linear time, but it has a very low resolution, and it may become trivial for phylogenetic trees with overlapping taxa, that is, phylogenetic trees that share some but not all of their leaf labels. In this article, we study the properties of the Generalized Robinson-Foulds (GRF) distance, a recently proposed metric for comparing any structures that can be described by multisets of multisets of labels, when applied to rooted phylogenetic trees with overlapping taxa, which are described by sets of clusters, that is, by sets of sets of labels. We show that the GRF distance has a very high resolution, it can also be computed in linear time, and it is not (uniformly) equivalent to the RF distance. }

  abstract = {The Robinson-Foulds (RF) metric is arguably the most widely used measure of phylogenetic tree similarity, despite its well-known shortcomings: For example, moving a single taxon in a tree can result in a tree that has maximum distance to the original one; but the two trees are identical if we remove the single taxon. To this end, we propose a natural extension of the RF metric that does not simply count identical clades but instead, also takes similar clades into consideration. In contrast to previous approaches, our model requires the matching between clades to respect the structure of the two trees, a property that the classical RF metric exhibits, too. We show that computing this generalized RF metric is, unfortunately, NP-hard. We then present a simple Integer Linear Program for its computation, and evaluate it by an all-against-all comparison of 100 trees from a benchmark data set. We find that matchings that respect the tree structure differ significantly from those that do not, underlining the importance of this natural condition.},

  abstract = {The sequencing of modern and ancient genomes from around the world has revolutionized our understanding of human history and evolution. However, the problem of how best to characterize ancestral relationships from the totality of human genomic variation remains unsolved. Here, we address this challenge with nonparametric methods that enable us to infer a unified genealogy of modern and ancient humans. This compact representation of multiple datasets explores the challenges of missing and erroneous data and uses ancient samples to constrain and date relationships. We demonstrate the power of the method to recover relationships between individuals and populations as well as to identify descendants of ancient samples. Finally, we introduce a simple nonparametric estimator of the geographical location of ancestors that recapitulates key events in human history. Hundreds of thousands of modern human genomes and thousands of ancient human genomes have been generated to date. However, different methods and data quality can make comparisons among them difficult. Furthermore, every human genome contains segments from ancestries of varying ages. Wohns et al. applied a tree recording method to ancient and modern human genomes to generate a unified human genealogy (see the Perspective by Rees and Andrés). This method allows for missing and erroneous data and uses ancient genomes to calibrate genomic coalescent times. This permits us to determine how our genomes have changed over time and between populations, informing upon the evolution of our species. —LMZ A genealogy of modern and ancient genomes provides insight into human history and evolution.},

Because of this, a large number of specialized simulation programs have been developed, each filling a particular niche, but with largely overlapping functionality and a substantial duplication of effort. Here, we introduce msprime version 1.0, which efficiently implements ancestry and mutation simulations based on the succinct tree sequence data structure and the tskit library. We summarize msprime’s many features, and show that its performance is excellent, often many times faster and more memory efficient than specialized alternatives. These high-performance features have been thoroughly tested and validated, and built using a collaborative, open source development model, which reduces duplication of effort and promotes software quality via community engagement.}},

  abstract = {As a result of recombination, adjacent nucleotides can have different paths of genetic inheritance and therefore the genealogical trees for a sample of DNA sequences vary along the genome. The structure capturing the details of these intricately interwoven paths of inheritance is referred to as an ancestral recombination graph (ARG). Classical formalisms have focused on mapping coalescence and recombination events to the nodes in an ARG. However, this approach is out of step with some modern developments, which do not represent genetic inheritance in terms of these events or explicitly infer them. We present a simple formalism that defines an ARG in terms of specific genomes and their intervals of genetic inheritance, and show how it generalizes these classical treatments and encompasses the outputs of recent methods. We discuss nuances arising from this more general structure, and argue that it forms an appropriate basis for a software standard in this rapidly growing field.},

  abstract = {The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Re-cent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.},

The canid family, including wolves and dogs, has undergone a series of disrupting mutations in this gene, rendering PRDM9 inactive. Given the importance of PRDM9, it is of great interest to learn how its absence in the dog genome affects patterns of recombination placement. We have used genotypes from domestic dog pedigrees to generate sex-specific genetic maps of recombination in this species. On a broad scale, we find that placement of recombination events in dogs is consistent with that in mice and apes, in that the majority of recombination occurs toward the telomeres in males, while female crossing over is more frequent and evenly spread along chromosomes. It has been previously suggested that dog recombination is more uniform in distribution than that of humans; however, we found that recombination in dogs is less uniform than in humans. We examined the distribution of recombination within the genome, and found that recombination is elevated immediately upstream of the transcription start site and around CpG islands, in agreement with previous studies, but that this effect is stronger in male dogs. We also found evidence for positive crossover interference influencing the spacing between recombination events in dogs, as has been observed in other species including humans and mice. Overall our data suggests that dogs have similar broad scale properties of recombination to humans, while fine scale recombination is similar to other species lacking PRDM9.},

The optimal proposal distribution for these problems can be characterized, and we exploit a detailed analysis of genealogical processes to develop a practicable approximation to it. We compare the new method with existing algorithms on a variety of genetic examples. Our approach substantially outperforms existing IS algorithms, with efficiency typically improved by several orders of magnitude. The new method also compares favourably with existing MCMC methods in some problems, and less favourably in others, suggesting that both IS and MCMC methods have a continuing role to play in this area.

@article{hein1990reconstructing,
  abstract = {The parsimony principle states that a history of a set of sequences that minimizes the amount of evolution is a good approximation to the real evolutionary history of the sequences. This principle is applied to the reconstruction of the evolution of homologous sequences where recombinations or horizontal transfer can occur. First it is demonstrated that the appropriate structure to represent the evolution of sequences with recombinations is a family of trees each describing the evolution of a segment of the sequence. Two trees for neighboring segments will differ by exactly the transfer of a subtree within the whole tree. This leads to a metric between trees based on the smallest number of such operations needed to convert one tree into the other. An algorithm is presented that calculates this metric. This metric is used to formulate a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the most parsimonious history that fits a given set of sequences. The algorithm is potentially very practical, since many groups of sequences defy analysis by methods that ignore recombinations. These methods give ambiguous or contradictory results because the sequence history cannot be described by one phylogeny, but only a family of phylogenies that each describe the history of a segment of the sequences. The generalization of the algorithm to reconstruct gene conversions and the possibility for heuristic versions of the algorithm for larger data sets are discussed.},

  abstract = {We describe some computational algorithms for computing probability distributions for sample configurations from the finite-sites models in population genetics. One particular interest is the development of computational methods for estimating substitution rates for DNA sequence data using likelihood techniques. The approach uses a recursion satisfied by the sampling probabilities to construct a Markov chain with a set of absorbing states in such a way that the required sampling distribution is the mean of a functional of the process up to the absorption time. This provides a conceptually simple framework for simulating the likelihood of the data for a set of parameter values. The method is particularly attractive in practice: it is simple to program and can be extended to cover other features of interest such as the infinitely-many-sites process, recombination, selection, and variable population size.},

@article{song2005constructing,
  abstract = { By viewing the ancestral recombination graph as defining a sequence of trees, we show how possible evolutionary histories consistent with given data can be constructed using the minimum number of recombination events. In contrast to previously known methods, which yield only estimated lower bounds, our method of detecting recombination always gives the minimum number of recombination events if the right kind of rooted trees are used in our algorithm. A new lower bound can be defined if rooted trees with fewer constraints are used. As well as studying how often it actually is equal to the minimum, we test how this new lower bound performs in comparison to some other lower bounds. Our study indicates that the new lower bound is an improvement on earlier bounds. Also, using simulated data, we investigate how well our method can recover the actual site-specific evolutionary relationships. In the presence of recombination, using a single tree to describe the evolution of the entire locus clearly leads to lower average recovery percentages than does our method. Our study shows that recovering the actual local tree topologies can be done more accurately than estimating the actual number of recombination events. },

@article{myers2003bounds,
  abstract = {Recombination is an important evolutionary factor in many organisms, including humans, and under-
standing its effects is an important task facing geneticists. Detecting past recombination events is thus
important; this article introduces statistics that give a lower bound on the number of recombination events
in the history of a sample, on the basis of the patterns of variation in the sample DNA. Such lower bounds
are appropriate, since many recombination events in the history are typically undetectable, so the true
number of historical recombinations is unobtainable. The statistics can be calculated quickly by computer
and improve upon the earlier bound of Hudson and Kaplan (1985). A method is developed to combine
bounds on local regions in the data to produce more powerful improved bounds. The method is flexible
to different models of recombination occurrence. The approach gives recombination event bounds between
all pairs of sites, to help identify regions with more detectable recombinations, and these bounds can be
viewed graphically. Under coalescent simulations, there is a substantial improvement over the earlier
method (of up to a factor of 2) in the expected number of recombination events detected by one of the
new minima, across a wide range of parameter values. The method is applied to data from a region within
the lipoprotein lipase gene and the amount of detected recombination is substantially increased. Further,
there is strong clustering of detected recombination events in an area near the center of the region. A
program implementing these statistics, which was used for this article, is available from http://www.stats.ox.

Different relative rates of recombination at different locations can be accommodated if they are known from external evidence, but the algorithm cannot itself estimate rate differences. The estimates of Θ are accurate and apparently unbiased for a wide range of parameter values.

The infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed where there may only be one mutation at a given site. Ancestral inference procedures are discussed for: estimating recombination and mutation rates; estimating the times to the most recent common ancestors along the sequences; estimating ages of mutations; and estimating the number of recombination events in the ancestry of the sample. Inferences are made conditional on the configuration of the pattern of mutations at sites in observed sample sequences. A computational algorithm based on a Markov chain simulation is developed, implemented, and illustrated with examples for these inference procedures. This algorithm is very computationally intensive. Key words: ancestral inference, population genetics, recombination, samples of DNA. },

The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

  abstract = {Large-scale association studies are being undertaken with the hope of uncovering the genetic determinants of complex disease. We describe a computationally efficient method for inferring genealogies from population genotype data and show how these genealogies can be used to fine map disease loci and interpret association signals. These genealogies take the form of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). The ARG defines a genealogical tree for each locus, and, as one moves along the chromosome, the topologies of consecutive trees shift according to the impact of historical recombination events. There are two stages to our analysis. First, we infer plausible ARGs, using a heuristic algorithm, which can handle unphased and missing data and is fast enough to be applied to large-scale studies. Second, we test the genealogical tree at each locus for a clustering of the disease cases beneath a branch, suggesting that a causative mutation occurred on that branch. Since the true ARG is unknown, we average this analysis over an ensemble of inferred ARGs. We have characterized the performance of our method across a wide range of simulated disease models. Compared with simpler tests, our method gives increased accuracy in positioning untyped causative loci and can also be used to estimate the frequencies of untyped causative alleles. We have applied our method to Ueda et al.’s association study of CTLA4 and Graves disease, showing how it can be used to dissect the association signal, giving potentially interesting results of allelic heterogeneity and interaction. Similar approaches analyzing an ensemble of ARGs inferred using our method may be applicable to many other problems of inference from population genotype data.},

  abstract = {Recent breakthroughs have enabled the inference of genealogies from large sequencing data-sets, accurately reconstructing local trees that describe genetic ancestry at each locus. These genealogies should also capture the correlation structure of local trees along the genome, reflecting historical recombination events and factors like demography and natural selection. However, whether reconstructed genealogies do accurately capture this correlation structure has not been rigorously explored. This is important to address, since uncovering regions that depart from expectations can drive the discovery of new biological phenomena. Addressing this is crucial, as uncovering regions that deviate from expectations can reveal new biological phenomena, such as the suppression of recombination allowing linked selection over broad regions, evidenced in humans and in adaptive introgression events in various species. We use a theoretical framework to characterise properties of genealogies, such as the distribution of genomic spans of clades and edges, and demonstrate that our theoretical results match observations in various simulated scenarios. Testing genealogies reconstructed using leading approaches, we find departures from theoretical expectations for all methods. However, for the method Relate, a set of simple corrections results in almost complete recovery of the target distributions. Applying these corrections to genealogies reconstructed using Relate for 2504 human genomes, we observe an excess of clades with unexpectedly long genomic spans (125 with p \< 1 {\textperiodcentered} 10-12 clustering into 50 regions), indicating localised suppression of historical recombination. The strongest signal corresponds to a known inversion on chromosome 17, while the second strongest represents a previously unknown inversion on chromosome 10, which is most common (21\%) in S. Asians and correlates with GWAS hits for a range of phenotypes including immunological traits. Other signals suggest additional large inversions (4), copy number changes (2), and complex rearrangements or other variants (12), as well as 28 regions with strong support but no clear classification. Our approach can be readily applied to other species, and show that genealogies offer previously untapped potential to study structural variation and its impacts at a population level, revealing new phenomena impacting evolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In human populations that we examined, the estimates of effective size were approximately one-third of the census size.

These identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events and, as such, contain ample signal to infer recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of IBD blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. We introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite-likelihood approach to fit these formulas. We then extensively evaluate our theory and inference method on a range of scenarios using simulated data. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match the simulated block-sharing patterns. We then demonstrate that our inference scheme can accurately and robustly infer dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the Population Reference Sample data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula: see text] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with increasing pairwise sample distance.},

Methods to uncover and visualize such relationships have widespread use for analyses in molecular ecology, conservation genetics, evolutionary genetics, and human genetics. While several frameworks exist, a promising approach is to infer maps of how migration rates vary across geographic space. Such maps could, in principle, be estimated across time to reveal the full complexity of population histories. Here, we take a step in this direction: we present a method to infer maps of population sizes and migration rates associated with different time periods from a matrix of genetic similarity between every pair of individuals. Specifically, genetic similarity is measured by counting the number of long segments of haplotype sharing (also known as identity-by-descent tracts). By varying the length of these segments we obtain parameter estimates associated with different time periods. Using simulations, we show that the method can reveal time-varying migration rates and population sizes, including changes that are not detectable when using a similar method that ignores haplotypic structure. We apply the method to a dataset of contemporary European individuals (POPRES), and provide an integrated analysis of recent population structure and growth over the last ∼3,000 years in Europe.},

  abstract = {If two haplotypes share the same alleles for an extended gene tract, these haplotypes are likely to derive identical-by-descent from a recent common ancestor. Identity-by-descent segment lengths are correlated via unobserved tree and recombination processes, which commonly presents challenges to the derivation of theoretical results in population genetics. Under interpretable regularity conditions, we show that the proportion of detectable identity-by-descent segments at a locus is normally distributed for large sample size and large scaled population size. We use efficient and exact simulations to study the distributional behavior of the detectable identity-by-descent rate in finite samples. One consequence of non-normality in finite samples is that genome-wide scans based on identity-by-descent rates may be subject to anti-conservative Type 1 error control.HighlightsWe show the asymptotic normality of the identity-by-descent rate, a mean of correlated binary random variables that arises in population genetics studies.We describe an efficient algorithm capable of simulating long identity-by-descent segments around a locus in large sample sizes.In enormous simulation studies, we use this algorithm to characterize the distributional properties of the identity-by-descent rate.In finite samples, we reject the null hypothesis of normality more often than the nominal significance level, indicating that genome-wide scans based on identity-by-descent rates may be anti-conservative.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Data-driven studies of identity by descent (IBD) were recently enabled by high-resolution genomic data from large cohorts and scalable algorithms for IBD detection. Yet, haplotype sharing currently represents an underutilized source of information for population-genetics research. We present analytical results on the relationship between haplotype sharing across purportedly unrelated individuals and a populations demographic history. We express the distribution of IBD sharing across pairs of individuals for segments of arbitrary length as a function of the populations demography, and we derive an inference procedure to reconstruct such demographic history. The accuracy of the proposed reconstruction methodology was extensively tested on simulated data. We applied this methodology to two densely typed data sets: 500 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and 56 Kenyan Maasai (MKK) individuals (HapMap 3 data set). Reconstructing the demographic history of the AJ cohort, we recovered two subsequent population expansions, separated by a severe founder event, consistent with previous analysis of lower-throughput genetic data and historical accounts of AJ history. In the MKK cohort, high levels of cryptic relatedness were detected. The spectrum of IBD sharing is consistent with a demographic model in which several small-sized demes intermix through high migration rates and result in enrichment of shared long-range haplotypes. This scenario of historically structured demographies might explain the unexpected abundance of runs of homozygosity within several populations.},

How this relates to genetic diversity remains largely unknown because of their limited engagement with genomic studies. Here we analyse the genomes of 159 individuals from four remote Indigenous communities, including people who speak a language (Tiwi) not from the most widespread family (Pama--Nyungan). This large collection of Indigenous Australian genomes was made possible by careful community engagement and consultation. We observe exceptionally strong population structure across Australia, driven by divergence times between communities of 26,000--35,000 years ago and long-term low but stable effective population sizes. This demographic history, including early divergence from Papua New Guinean (47,000 years ago) and Eurasian groups1, has generated the highest proportion of previously undescribed genetic variation seen outside Africa and the most extended homozygosity compared with global samples. A substantial proportion of this variation is not observed in global reference panels or clinical datasets, and variation with predicted functional consequence is more likely to be homozygous than in other populations, with consequent implications for medical genomics2. Our results show that Indigenous Australians are not a single homogeneous genetic group and their genetic relationship with the peoples of New Guinea is not uniform. These patterns imply that the full breadth of Indigenous Australian genetic diversity remains uncharacterized, potentially limiting genomic medicine and equitable healthcare for Indigenous Australians.},

By exploiting efficient data encoding based on the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), we obtain three major advantages over current approaches: (i) no need to impose a length threshold on IBD segments, (ii) IBD can be defined without the hard-to-verify requirement of no recombination, and (iii) computation time can be reduced with little loss of statistical efficiency using only the IBD segments from a set of sequence pairs that scales linearly with sample size. We first demonstrate powerful inferences when true IBD information is available from simulated data. For IBD inferred from real data, we propose an approximate Bayesian computation inference algorithm and use it to show that poorly-inferred short IBD segments can improve estimation precision. We show estimation precision similar to a previously-published estimator despite a 4 000-fold reduction in data used for inference. Computational cost limits model complexity in our approach, but we are able to incorporate unknown nuisance parameters and model misspecification, still finding improved parameter inference.Author summary Samples of genome sequences can be informative about the history of the population from which they were drawn, and about mutation and other processes that led to the observed sequences. However, obtaining reliable inferences is challenging, because of the complexity of the underlying processes and the large amounts of sequence data that are often now available. A common approach to simplifying the data is to use only genome segments that are very similar between two sequences, called identical-by-descent (IBD). The longer the IBD segment the more informative about recent shared ancestry, and current approaches restrict attention to IBD segments above a length threshold. We instead are able to use IBD segments of any length, allowing us to extract much more information from the sequence data. To reduce the computation burden we identify subsets of the available sequence pairs that lead to little information loss. Our approach exploits recent advances in inferring aspects of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) underlying the sample of sequences. Computational cost still limits the size and complexity of problems our method can handle, but where feasible we obtain dramatic improvements in the power of inferences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We analyze whole genome sequence data generated from 640 new and 3089 publicly available Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates. We demonstrate that positive selection distorts IBD distributions, leading to underestimated effective population size and blurred population structure. Additionally, we discover that the removal of IBD peak regions partially restores the accuracy of IBD-based inferences, with this effect contingent on the population's background genetic relatedness and extent of inbreeding. Consequently, we advocate for selection correction for parasite populations undergoing strong, recent positive selection, particularly in high malaria transmission settings.},
